# AI Algorithms - Semester 3 (2025)

Welcome to the **AI Algorithms** repository!  
This project contains implementations of fundamental **searching algorithms** commonly used in the field of **Artificial Intelligence**.

## ðŸ“š About

During **Semester 3 (2025)** of our BTech course, we are focusing on core AI concepts, starting with **searching techniques**.  
This repository includes popular algorithms such as:
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- A* Search
- Greedy Best-First Search  
and moreâ€¦

Each algorithm is implemented in a clean, understandable way with comments for easy learning and reference.
